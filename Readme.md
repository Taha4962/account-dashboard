Device Management Component
This component allows you to manage device access for your application. It includes a single page with a form to revoke access to a specific device.

Prerequisites
Before using this component, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js and npm installed on your computer
A backend API that can handle requests to revoke device access
Installation
To install this component, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.
Usage
To use this component, follow these steps:

Start your backend API and make sure it's running on the correct URL and port.
Update the proxy key in the package.json file to point to your backend API.
Run npm start to start the development server.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/device-management/:deviceId in your browser, where :deviceId is the ID of the device you want to manage.
Click the "Revoke Access" button to revoke access to the device.
Component Structure
The component consists of a single page with the following structure:

A read-only input field that displays the device ID.
A button to revoke access to the device.
Component Implementation
The component is implemented using React and the react-router-dom library for routing. The useParams hook is used to retrieve the device ID from the URL. The axios library is used to make HTTP requests to the backend API.

The handleRevokeAccess function is called when the "Revoke Access" button is clicked. It makes a POST request to the backend API to revoke access to the device. If the request is successful, the device's access token is removed from local storage and an alert is displayed to the user. If the request fails, an error alert is displayed.
